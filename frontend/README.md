# Getting Started with the React E-commerce Site

This repository contains a React site built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. This README file provides instructions on how to get started with the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the React site locally, ensure that you have the following software installed on your machine:

<ul>
    <li>
        Node.js (version 14 or later)
    </li>
    <li>
    npm (Node Package Manager, typically comes bundled with Node.js)
    </li>
</ul>

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Gaurav-jo1/E-commerce.git
```

2. Navigate to the project's root directory:

```
cd E-commerce/frontend
```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm:

```
npm install
```

## Development Server

To run the React site locally, you can use the development server provided by Vite.

1. Start the development server by running the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

2. Vite will compile the TypeScript code and start the development server. You should see a message indicating the server is running, along with the local URL where the site can be accessed (e.g., http://localhost:8000).

3. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local URL to view the React site.

4. As you make changes to the source code, the development server will automatically reload the site in the browser.

## Build for Production

To build the React site for production, follow these steps:

1. Run the build command:

```
npm run build
```

2. Vite will compile and optimize the code for production, generating a dist folder in the project directory.

3. The optimized files are ready for deployment and can be found in the dist folder.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the code and customize the React site according to your needs. The project structure follows common conventions for React with TypeScript, and you can find the main source files in the src directory.
